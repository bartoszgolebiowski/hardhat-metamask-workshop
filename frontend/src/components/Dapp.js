 * @property {() => Promise<any>} symbol
 * Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.
 * @property {() => Promise<any>} decimals
 * Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation. For example, if decimals equals 2, a balance of 505 tokens should be displayed to a user as 5,05 (505 / 10 ** 2).
 * Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value ERC20 uses, unless _setupDecimals is called.

 * Returns the amount of tokens in existence.
 * @property {(address: string) => Promise<any>} balanceOf
 * Returns the amount of tokens owned by account.
 * @property {(recipient: string, amount: number)=> Promise<any>} transfer
 * Moves amount tokens from the caller’s account to recipient.
 * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
 * Emits a **Transfer** event.
 * @property {(sender:string, recipient: string, amount: number)=> Promise<any>} transferFrom
 * Emits an **Approval** event indicating the updated allowance. This is not required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of ERC20.
 * Requirements:

 * Returns the remaining number of tokens that spender will be allowed to spend on behalf of owner through transferFrom. This is zero by default.
 * This value changes when approve or transferFrom are called.

 * Atomically increases the allowance granted to spender by the caller.
